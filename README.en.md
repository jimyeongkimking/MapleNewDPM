# simaple: Simulation library for Maplestory

`simaple` is a library to analyse the combat environment in MapleStory.

simaple uses client resources to construct a simulation environment for MapleStory jobs to calculate the expected DPM and relative DPM-share of each skill. Different combat scenario parameters can be specified.

- Provides a realistic simulation environment based on actual game parameters in MapleStory
- Generates and analyses battle results including the expected DPM of the character with given specifications
- Provides a simulation environment based on in-game user information
- Calculates multi-faceted metrics to describe character spec level, such as converted stat (via the popular KMS Stat Conversion sheet)


## Web Client

simaple also provides a web interface to factilitate simulation.

## Supported Features

### In-game simulation
- Create an interactive simulation environment
  - Create a simulation environment with all variables present in-game, such as reduced/skipped cooldowns, increased buff duration, and V Matrix Enhancement Cores
- Real-time analyses of simulation results
  - DPM calculation
  - Relative dpm-share of each skill
  - Output results in a human-readable format for more thorough analysis

### Equipment related
- Calculate expected performance of equipment when applying specified Star Force and Scroll upgrades
